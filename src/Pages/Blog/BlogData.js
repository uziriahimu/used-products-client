            Answer: "The main objective of unit testing is to isolate written code to test and determine if it works as intended.

            Question: "React vs. Angular vs. Vue?",
            Answer: "Vue provides higher customizability and hence is easier to learn than Angular or React. Further, Vue has an overlap with Angular and React with respect to their functionality like the use of components. Hence, the transition to Vue from either of the two is an easy option."
